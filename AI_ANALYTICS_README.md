## API Costs

### Gemini API Pricing (as of 2024)

**Free Tier:**
- 60 queries per minute
- 1,500 queries per day
- Perfect for development and small-scale usage

**Paid Tier** (if needed):
- ~$0.001 - $0.005 per query
- Extremely affordable compared to OpenAI GPT-4

**Estimated Costs:**
- 100 queries/day = ~$0.10 - $0.50/day
- 1,000 queries/day = ~$1 - $5/day

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Failed to generate AI response"**
- Check if `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Verify API key is valid at Google AI Studio
- Check internet connectivity
- Review rate limits (60 queries/min)

**2. "Query timeout"**
- Query took longer than 10 seconds
- Try simplifying the question
- Use templates instead of free-form queries

**3. "Access denied to table"**
- Trying to access data outside role permissions
- Use templates which are pre-validated
- Ensure you're querying allowed tables for your role

**4. "SQL injection detected"**
- Query contains forbidden keywords (DROP, DELETE, etc.)
- Rephrase question to be more natural
- Use templates for complex queries

### Debug Mode

Check browser console and server logs for detailed error messages:
```bash
# Server logs will show:
âœ… Status update email sent...
Executing SQL: SELECT...
Gemini API Error: ...
```
