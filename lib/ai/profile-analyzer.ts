STUDENT PROFILE:
- CGPA: ${studentProfile.cgpa}
- Degree: ${studentProfile.degree}
- Course: ${studentProfile.course}
- Skills: ${studentProfile.skills} skills listed (${studentProfile.skillsList.slice(0, 10).join(", ")})

- Certifications: ${studentProfile.certifications} certifications
- Work Experience: ${studentProfile.experience} entries
- Total Applications: ${studentProfile.totalApplications}

MARKET INSIGHTS:
- Top skills in demand: ${topSkillsInMarket.join(", ")}
- Average skills expected: ${averageRequirements.skills}
- Average projects expected: ${averageRequirements.projects}
- Active job opportunities: ${activeJobs.length}

TASK:
Analyze this student's profile and identify 3-5 key gaps or areas for improvement. For each gap:
1. Categorize it (projects, skills, certifications, experience, or education)
2. Provide a clear, encouraging title
3. Explain why this is important for their career
4. Give 2-4 specific, actionable steps they can take

Prioritize gaps that will have the most impact on their job prospects. Be specific and practical.`;
