RESUME CONTENT (EXTRACTED FROM PDF):
"""
${resumeText}
"""

${hasJD ? `JOB DESCRIPTION:
"""
${jobDescription}
"""` : 'No specific job description provided'}

YOUR TASK:
Analyze the ACTUAL resume content above and provide ${hasJD ? 'targeted analysis comparing it against the job description' : 'general ATS optimization feedback'}:

1. **ATS Score (0-100)**: 
   - Analyze the ACTUAL resume structure, formatting, and content quality
   - ${hasJD ? 'Compare keywords in resume against job description requirements' : 'Evaluate based on general best practices'}
   - IMPORTANT: Use the FULL range (0-100) based on actual resume quality
   - Score Guidelines:
     * 0-40: Poor/Horrible - Major formatting issues, missing sections, unprofessional
     * 40-60: Below Average - Basic structure but lacking keywords, weak formatting
     * 60-75: Average - Decent structure, some optimization needed
     * 75-85: Good - Well-structured, good keywords, minor improvements needed
     * 85-95: Excellent - Highly optimized, strong keywords, professional formatting
     * 95-100: Outstanding - Perfect ATS optimization, ideal structure and content

2. **Keyword Analysis**:
   ${hasJD ? `- Compare the resume content against the job description
   - List keywords that ARE PRESENT in both (keywordMatches)
   - List keywords from JD that ARE MISSING from resume (missingKeywords)
   - Be accurate - only list keywords as "missing" if they're truly absent from the resume text` : `- List 5-7 technical skills and keywords found IN the resume
   - DO NOT list missing keywords without a job description
   - Focus on what's present in the resume`}

3. **Formatting Score (0-100)** - Use full range based on quality:
   - Standard best practices: use simple formatting, avoid tables/columns
   - Use standard section headings: Experience, Education, Skills, Projects
   - Avoid: images, graphics, headers/footers, multiple columns
   - Score Guidelines:
     * 0-40: Poor - Multiple columns, graphics, ATS-incompatible format
     * 40-60: Below Average - Some formatting issues, inconsistent structure
     * 60-75: Average - Decent formatting with some issues
     * 75-85: Good - Clean, ATS-friendly with minor issues
     * 85-100: Excellent - Perfect ATS formatting, clean and professional

4. **Content Score (0-100)** - Use full range based on quality:
   - Use action verbs (Developed, Implemented, Led, etc.)
   - Include quantifiable achievements (increased by X%, reduced by Y)
   - Ensure all sections are complete and well-organized
   - Score Guidelines:
     * 0-40: Poor - Vague descriptions, no achievements, missing sections
     * 40-60: Below Average - Basic descriptions, few accomplishments
     * 60-75: Average - Decent content but lacking impact
     * 75-85: Good - Strong action verbs, some quantifiable results
     * 85-100: Excellent - Compelling content, quantified achievements throughout

5. **Strengths**: 3-5 strengths found IN THIS SPECIFIC resume

6. **Weaknesses**: 3-5 weaknesses or areas for improvement found IN THIS SPECIFIC resume

7. **Specific Suggestions**: 5-8 actionable recommendations based on THIS SPECIFIC resume content

${hasJD ? 'IMPORTANT: Base your keyword matching on ACTUAL comparison of the resume text vs job description. Only mark keywords as "missing" if they are truly absent from the resume.' : 'Focus on general best practices based on what you see in the resume. DO NOT list missing keywords without a job description.'}

CRITICAL SCORING RULES:
- Use the ENTIRE 0-100 scale based on actual quality
- Do NOT cluster all scores in 65-80 range
- A truly bad resume should score 30-50
- An average resume should score 60-75
- A good resume should score 75-85
- An excellent resume should score 85-95
- Only near-perfect resumes should score 95+
- Be honest and realistic - vary scores significantly based on quality

Be practical, specific, and encouraging in your feedback.`;
