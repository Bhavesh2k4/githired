## 📦 Packages Installed

- `@aws-sdk/client-s3` - S3 client for DigitalOcean Spaces
- `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` - Presigned URL generation

## 🔧 What You Need to Do

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_url
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=random_secret
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_key
DO_SPACES_ENDPOINT=https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
DO_SPACES_REGION=nyc3
DO_SPACES_KEY=your_key
DO_SPACES_SECRET=your_secret
DO_SPACES_BUCKET=your_bucket
```

See `QUICKSTART.md` for detailed setup.

### 2. Run Database Migrations

```bash
npx drizzle-kit generate
npx drizzle-kit push
```

### 3. Create First Admin User

After signing up through the app:

```sql
UPDATE "user" SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-admin@example.com';
```

### 4. Test the System

**Student Flow:**
1. Sign up → Auto-created as `pending`
2. Edit profile → Add SRN, resume, skills
3. Wait for approval → See pending page
4. Get approved → Access full dashboard

**Admin Flow:**
1. Log in as admin → Auto-redirect to `/dashboard/admin`
2. View pending students → Filter and search
3. Approve/reject → Add notes if needed
4. Verify SRN → Manual verification option
5. Ban/unban → Manage violations

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### SRN Validation
Default format: `^[A-Z]{3}\d[A-Z]{2}\d{2}[A-Z]{2}\d{3}$`

Example: `PES1UG20CS001`

To customize, edit `server/students.ts` line 8.

### Resume Upload
- Only PDF files allowed
- Max size enforced by DigitalOcean Spaces
- Presigned URLs expire in 15 minutes
- Files stored at `resumes/{userId}/{timestamp}-{filename}`

### Admin Creation
Admins must be created manually in the database. There's no sign-up flow for admins for security reasons.

### Email Configuration
Update email sender in `lib/auth.ts`:
- Change from: `'NoteForge <noteforge@orcdev.com>'`
- To your domain

## 🐛 Debugging Tips

### If students can't access dashboard:
- Check their `status` in `students` table
- Verify middleware is running
- Check browser console for errors

### If resume upload fails:
- Verify DO Spaces credentials
- Check CORS configuration
- Ensure bucket has public-read ACL

### If admin can't see students:
- Verify `role = 'admin'` in `user` table
- Check session is valid
- Verify API endpoint responses

## 📊 Database Quick Reference

```sql
-- Check student status
SELECT email, status, srn, srn_valid FROM students;

-- Make user admin
UPDATE "user" SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- Approve student manually
UPDATE students SET status = 'approved' WHERE email = 'student@example.com';

-- View statistics
SELECT 
  status, 
  COUNT(*) as count 
FROM students 
GROUP BY status;
```
