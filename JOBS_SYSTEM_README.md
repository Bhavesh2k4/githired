  - Course is in job's eligible courses list (if set)
  - Degree is in job's eligible degrees list (if set)
- If any criteria is not met, student cannot apply

### Job Status
- **Active**: Visible to all students, accepts applications
- **Stopped**: Only visible to students who already applied, no new applications

### Email Notifications
- When a company posts a job, emails are automatically sent to:
  - All approved students
  - Who meet the eligibility criteria (CGPA + course + degree)
  - Using the existing Resend integration

### Application Ranking
Applications are ranked by a combined score:
- CGPA × 10 (primary factor)
- Skills match percentage (secondary factor)
- Higher scores appear first

### Access Control
- Only **verified companies** can post jobs
- Only **approved students** can view and apply to jobs
- Students can only apply once per job
- Companies can only see their own jobs and applications
- Admin can see everything

## Troubleshooting

**Students can't see jobs:**

- Check that jobs are set to "active" status

**Companies can't post jobs:**
- Company must be verified AND approved by admin
- Check company.verified = true and company.status = "approved"

**Email notifications not sending:**
- Verify RESEND_API_KEY is set
- Check server logs for email send errors
- Emails only sent to students meeting eligibility criteria

**Applications not showing:**
- Ensure student has CGPA, degree, and course filled in profile
- Check that student meets eligibility criteria
- Verify job is still active
